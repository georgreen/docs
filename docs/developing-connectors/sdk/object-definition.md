# Object Definitions and structuring input and output fields
Object Definitions are an important component of the SDK. It allows you to define your schema for objects to be used in the actions and triggers. While we have gone through examples on how to do this directly from inside your `input_fields:` and `output_fields:` blocks, object_definitions allow you to declare it once and reuse it multiple times in various areas of your connector code.

> Object definitions are a key indicator of well written code. It makes your custom connector more maintainable and easier to read.

After that, we will dive deeper into the details of how you can clearly define your input and output fields. This will have important effects on what end users see when building recipes using your connector.

## Static object definitions
The most basic way to build an object definition is to define the field name and type

### Sample code snippet
```ruby
{
  title: 'My close.io connector',

  connection: {
    # Some code here
  },
  test: {
    # Some code here
  },
  actions: {

    get_lead_by_id: {
      input_fields: lambda do
        [
          { name: "lead_id", optional: false }
        ]
      end,

      execute: lambda do |connection, input|
        get("https://app.close.io/api/v1/lead/#{input["lead_id"]}/")
      end,

      output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|
        object_definitions["lead"]
      end
    }

  },

  triggers: {
    # Some code here
  },

  object_definitions: {
    lead: {
      fields: lambda do
        [
          { name: "name", type: :boolean },
          { name: "email" },
          { name: "number"}
        ]
      end
    }
  }

  picklists: {
    # Some code here
  },
  methods: {
    # Some code here
  },
}
```

In this example, the object `leads` is being defined in the fields lambda function. This can then be easily referenced in the action above. Defined as an array of objects. Each field object corresponds to a field in the lead object.

## Dynamic object definitions
Object definitions can also be used to dynamically generate input and output schemas. This is often done by a HTTP requests to metadata endpoints which return data about what fields to expect. Below we go through a simple example of using a `GET` request to a metadata endpoint to know what fields to expect in a form.

### Sample code snippet
```ruby
object_definitions: {
  form: {
    fields: lambda do |connection|
      get("https://api.unbounce.com/pages/#{connection['page_id']}/form_fields")["formFields"].
        map { |field| { name: field["id"] } }
    end
  }
}
```

Remember that the ultimate output of the lambda function would still have to be in the format that Workato expects. This often means using ruby methods like `map` to transform the response from an HTTP call.

### Testing
Testing and debugging your object definitions can be done in the same way that you would for your actions or triggers. Make sure that your object definition is being used in a specific action and test that action in the code editor. HTTP calls from the object definition should be recorded in the `Network` tab and any `puts` functions in your object definition block should be displayed in the `Console` tab as well.

## Structuring input and output fields
Up until now, our sample code snippets have largely only included the basic parameters such as `name` when defining input and output fields. Workato allows you to define a much larger set of variables that affect the way your fields are displayed to end users.

### Control types
Control types are a way for you to declare how input fields are displayed to users of your connector.

## Variations

### Nested objects
Often, data returned from API request is not a simple one-level JSON. More often than not, the returned JSON object is much more complex, with multiple levels of nesting. This section aims to illustrate how to define nested fields.

#### Sample code snippet
```json
{
  "id": "00ub0oNGTSWTBKOLGLNR",
  "status": "STAGED",
  "created": "2013-07-02T21:36:25.344Z",
  "activated": null,
  "lastLogin": "2013-07-02T21:36:25.344Z",
  "profile": {
    "firstName": "Isaac",
    "lastName": "Brock",
    "email": "isaac.brock@example.com",
    "login": "isaac.brock@example.com",
    "mobilePhone": "555-415-1337"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "provider": {
      "type": "OKTA",
      "name": "OKTA"
    }
  },
  "_links": {
    "activate": {
      "href": "https://your-domain.okta.com/api/v1/users/00ub0oNGTSWTBKOLGLNR/lifecycle/activate"
    }
  }
}
```

Nested object field `profile` can be defined `type: :object` with fields nested inside using `properties`. Properties should be an array of fields objects (just like `fields` within the `user` object).

```ruby
object_definitions: {
  user: {
    fields: lambda do
      [
        {
          name: "id"
        },
        {
          name: "status"
        },
        {
          name: "created",
          type: :timestamp
        },
        {
          name: "activated",
          type: :timestamp
        },
        {
          name: "lastLogin",
          type: :timestamp
        },
        {
          name: "profile",
          type: :object,
          properties: [
            {
              name: "firstName"
            },
            {
              name: "lastName"
            },
            {
              name: "email",
              control_type: :email
            },
            {
              name: "login",
              control_type: :email
            },
            {
              name: "mobilePhone",
              control_type: :phone
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    end
  }
}
```

### Nested Arrays
The other common type of nested field is array of objects. This type of field contains a list of repeated objects of the same fields. The defining such fields will be very similar to defining objects. Take the following sample `user` object from Asana for instance.

#### Sample code snippet
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 12149914544379,
    "email": "eeshan@workato.com",
    "name": "Ee Shan",
    "workspaces": [
      {
        "id": 1041269201604,
        "name": "Workato"
      },
      {
        "id": 498346130780,
        "name": "Product Documentation"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `workspaces` array should be given `type: :array` as well as `of: :object`. This tells the `object_definitions` framework that the field contains an array of objects. Similar to nested objects, you will need to define `properties`, which is an array of fields corresponding to the fields of each object in the `workspaces` array.

```ruby
object_definitions: {
  user: {
    fields: lambda do
      [
        {
          name: 'id',
          type: :integer
        },
        { name: 'name' },
        {
          name: 'email',
          control_type: :phone
        },
        {
          name: 'workspaces',
          type: :array,
          of: :object,
          properties: [
            {
              name: 'id',
              label: 'Workspace ID',
              type: :integer
            },
            { name: 'name' }
          ]
        }
      ]
    end
  }
}
```

### Next section
The next section goes through some additional concepts related to object definitions which we call picklists. Pick lists allow you to declare dropdowns for your users instead of have to enter text. [Go to our picklist documentation](/developing-connectors/sdk/pick-list.md) or check our our [best practices](/developing-connectors/sdk/best-practices.md) for some tips on how to use object definitions.
